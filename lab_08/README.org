Code Comments (BY : Shania Dhani)

/*
I included  a Makefile to build program and bad-code.cpp to 
rough test your code.

Your removeLeadSpaces function works as intended, however, 
the countChar function does not retain it's value regarding
the previous bracket count because the count is reinitialized
every time it enters the function. 

(At least that is one way of
thinking about it). Because I used it this way, the variables I 
are static variables from the storage class. 

All other comments are in the program
